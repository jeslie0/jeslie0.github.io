  <p>In mathematics, we are familiar with putting structure on sets, for example a group is a set with a binary operation satisfying certain properties. We can extend this notion to categories. The first examples I came across in my studies were monoidal categories, which are used to abstract the notion of a tensor product, and have deep ties to quantum mechanics and physics.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <em>monoidal category</em> is a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> with a functor <span class="math inline">\( \otimes: \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}\)</span>, an object <span class="math inline">\( I \in \mathcal{C}\)</span> called the unit and the following natural isomorphisms, written in terms of their components:</p>
<ol>
<li>An associator <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{A,B,C}: (A \otimes B) \otimes C \rightarrow A \otimes (B \otimes C)\)</span>,</li>
<li>A left unitor <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_A: I \otimes A \rightarrow A\)</span>,</li>
<li>A right unitor <span class="math inline">\(\rho_A: A \otimes I \rightarrow A\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>These maps all have to satisfy the following diagrams, aptly named the triangle and pentagon identities.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{tikzcd}

                                                                                                                                    \end{tikzcd}\]</span></p>

<p>These two diagrams remarkably lead to a coherence theorem which states that every well formed formula built from <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \lambda, \rho\)</span> and their inverses holds. This gives us for free that <span class="math inline">\( \rho_I = \lambda_I\)</span>, which would otherwise be very painful to prove.</p>
<p>The classic example of a monoidal category is <span class="math inline">\( \mathbf{Hilb}\)</span>, the category of Hilbert spaces with morphisms as bounded linear maps. The tensor functor simply gives the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces and the unit object is <span class="math inline">\( \mathbb{C}\)</span>, the complex numbers. The natural transformations are given in the obvious way. We can turn <span class="math inline">\( \mathbf{Set}\)</span> into a monoidal category by having the <span class="math inline">\( \otimes\)</span> functor give the Cartesian product of two sets and having the terminal object 1 as the unit.</p>
<p>The study of both <span class="math inline">\( \mathbf{Hilb}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\( \mathbf{Set}\)</span> are useful for physics. The former is used to formalize quantum mechanics and the latter classical physics. One property that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Hilb}\)</span> has that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span> doesn’t is the existence of a zero object. This is an object, denoted <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, which is both initial and terminal, that is, given any other object <span class="math inline">\( A\)</span>, there is exactly one morphism <span class="math inline">\( 0 \rightarrow A\)</span> and exactly one morphism <span class="math inline">\( A \rightarrow 0\)</span>. It isn’t hard to see that <span class="math inline">\( \mathbf{Hilb}\)</span>, the zero object is simply the Hilbert space consisting of just a zero vector. It is also not difficult to show that <span class="math inline">\( \mathbf{Set}\)</span> doesn’t have a zero object, since if it did it would need to be isomorphic to both the one element set and the empty set, which is impossible.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that in <span class="math inline">\( \mathbf{Hilb}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\( 0 \otimes 0 \cong 0\)</span>. This is true for all monoidal categories with a zero object, as we shall now prove. I highly recommend trying this exercise for yourself first!</p>
<p>We have the following unique arrows: <span class="math inline">\( f: I \rightarrow 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\( g:0 \rightarrow I\)</span>. These give rise to maps <span class="math inline">\( f \otimes 1_0:I \otimes 0 \rightarrow 0 \otimes 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\( g \otimes 1_0: 0 \otimes 0 \rightarrow I \otimes0\)</span>. We then get the following composites:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math inline">\( 0 \xrightarrow{\lambda_0^{-1}} I \otimes 0 \xrightarrow{f \otimes 1_0} 0 \otimes 0\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(0 \otimes 0 \xrightarrow{g \otimes 1_0} I \otimes 0 \xrightarrow{\lambda_0} 0\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As <span class="math inline">\( 0\)</span> is a zero-object, there is only one map <span class="math inline">\( 0 \rightarrow 0\)</span>, namely the identity map <span class="math inline">\( 1_0\)</span>. This means</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\left(\lambda_0 \circ (g \otimes 1_0)\right) \circ \left((f \otimes 1_0) \circ \lambda_0^{-1} \right)= 1_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>We also see that <span class="math inline">\( f \circ g:0 \rightarrow 0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\( f \circ g = 1_0\)</span>. We can then build the following commuting square:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r, &quot;g&quot;] \arrow[d, &quot;1_0&quot;'] &amp; I \arrow[d, &quot;1_I&quot;] \\
0                                  &amp; I \arrow[l, &quot;f&quot;]  
\end{tikzcd} \]</span></p>
<p>We can apply the functor <span class="math inline">\( - \otimes 0\)</span> to this square to get the following square:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \otimes 0 \arrow[r, &quot;g \otimes 1_0&quot;] \arrow[d, &quot;1_0 \otimes 1_0&quot;'] &amp; I \otimes 0 \arrow[d, &quot;1_I&quot;]           \\
0 \otimes 0                                                          &amp; I \otimes 0 \arrow[l, &quot;f \otimes 1_0&quot;]
\end{tikzcd}\]</span></p>
<p>Factoring <span class="math inline">\( 1_{I \otimes 0} = \lambda_0^{-1} \circ \lambda_0\)</span> gives the following diagram:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \otimes 0 \arrow[r, &quot;g \otimes 1_0&quot;] \arrow[d, &quot;1_0 \otimes 1_0&quot;'] &amp; I \otimes 0 \arrow[d, &quot;1_I&quot;] \arrow[r, &quot;\lambda_0&quot;] &amp; 0 \arrow[ld, &quot;\lambda_0^{-1}&quot;] \\
0 \otimes 0                                                          &amp; I \otimes 0 \arrow[l, &quot;f \otimes 1_0&quot;]              &amp;                               
\end{tikzcd}\]</span></p>
<p>We also know that <span class="math inline">\( 1_0 \otimes 1_0 = 1_{0 \otimes0}\)</span>, from the tensor product functor. As this commutes, we have <span class="math inline">\( \left((f \otimes 1_0) \circ \lambda_0^{-1} \right) \circ  \left(\lambda_0 \circ (g \otimes 1_0)\right) = 1_{0\otimes0}\)</span>. This results in the maps (1) and (2) being mutual inverses, hence <span class="math inline">\( 0 \cong 0 \otimes 0\)</span>, as required.</p>
<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to monoidal categories, for example, we might want <span class="math inline">\( A \otimes B \cong B \otimes A\)</span>, in which case we need to look at braided monoidal categories.
