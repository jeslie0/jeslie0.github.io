I knew I had to make it up to him, so we went for a nice walk along the river this morning, through the fog. It was actually quite nice outside - the ground was dry and firm. Thankfully, no rain! Woody was very happy to get to go to Pets At Home on the walk and get a few bags of his favourite treats.<p><img src=../images/woody/2025/03/IMG_8067.JPEG width=230></div></div><div class=additional-section><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=jeslie0/jeslie0.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDOG3FkcQ data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOG3Fkcc4CPMWW data-mapping=title data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=top data-theme=dark data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></main><footer><p>Page updated with commit 21a9d48 on 2025-03-01, by James Leslie<p>Site made with â™¥ using <a href=https://orgmode.org/>org-mode</a> and <a href=https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll>hakyll</a>.
