We were slightly disappointed to not served any food or drinks, but they did make sure Woody had some nice treats. We had a nice walk back home, where Woody decided it was best to try and snuggle up and sleep.<p><img src=../images/woody/IMG_7735.JPEG width=230></div></div><div class=additional-section><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=jeslie0/jeslie0.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDOG3FkcQ data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOG3Fkcc4CPMWW data-mapping=title data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=top data-theme=dark data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></main><footer><p>Page updated with commit b0bc988 on 2024-12-01, by James Leslie<p>Site made with â™¥ using <a href=https://orgmode.org/>org-mode</a> and <a href=https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll>hakyll</a>.
