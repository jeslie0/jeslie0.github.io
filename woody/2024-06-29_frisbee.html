He was very tired from sprinting about and fetching so well. I am so proud of Woody - it is very easy to think of times when he would never fetch anything outside, but now I trust him to come back to me even in the presence of other dogs. I know that Mohabat is proud of him.<p><img src=../images/woody/IMG_7605.JPEG width=230></div></div><div class=additional-section><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=jeslie0/jeslie0.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDOG3FkcQ data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOG3Fkcc4CPMWW data-mapping=title data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=top data-theme=dark data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></main><footer><p>Site made with â™¥ using <a href=https://orgmode.org/>org-mode</a> and <a href=https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll>hakyll</a><p><a href=../rss.xml><i class="fas fa-rss-square"></i></a><p>Page updated with commit 9211fed on 2024-09-08, by James Leslie</footer>
