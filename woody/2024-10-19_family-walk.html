Woody was very well behaved and got to make friends (and even some enemies) with many doggies. He particularly enjoyed the ice cream that he was given by the Italian man in the ice cream van. I’m sure he burnt it off with all the running about he did though.<p>He was also very well behaved in the car journey there and was particularly snuggly!<p><img src=../images/woody/IMG_7776.JPEG width=230></div></div><div class=additional-section><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=jeslie0/jeslie0.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDOG3FkcQ data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOG3Fkcc4CPMWW data-mapping=title data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=top data-theme=dark data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></main><footer><p>Page updated with commit b1411ef on 2024-10-29, by James Leslie<p>Site made with ♥ using <a href=https://orgmode.org/>org-mode</a> and <a href=https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll>hakyll</a>.
