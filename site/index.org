* About Me
Since mid 2022, I have been employed by [[https://waymont.com/][Waymont Consulting]] as a Software Consultant, developing software using C++ and React. Outside of work, I develop most of my projects using Haskell with PureScript for web development.

In 2018, I graduated with a Masters in Mathematics from The University of Edinburgh (2018), with my thesis introducing toposes and their logic. From 2019-2021, I was a PhD student at The University of Western Ontario, researching the syntax and semantics of homotopy and cubical Type Theories. Academically, my interests are in the foundations of mathematics through logic, set and topos theory, and (homotopy) type theory.
I am in the process of building an Agda library for homotopy type theory, mainly based off of work from The HoTT Book. Outside of mathematics, I enjoy programming in Haskell and learning about its interactions with category theory.
I am a Linux and Emacs user and enjoy system crafting as a hobby. My dotfiles repository for my NixOS system can be found [[https://github.com/jeslie0/.dotfiles][here]]. I use my own custom Emacs framework which is highly tailored to my uses. While I don't think anyone else will gain anything by using it, it might give some ideas about how to make your own Emacs "distribution". It can be found [[https://github.com/jeslie0/New-Emacs][here]].
Outside of Mathematics and coding, I enjoy [[file:images/running.jpg][running]], [[file:images/cycling.jpg][cycling]], swimming, and more recently, I have also taken up [[file:images/bouldering.jpeg][bouldering]] as a hobby.
