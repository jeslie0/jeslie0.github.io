It was a lovely and sunny day on Sunday, so we decided to venture out and grab some food at a local pub.

The walk was slightly muddy at points, but Woody managed to dart around the biggest of the puddles, thankfully. We were slightly disappointed to not served any food or drinks, but they did make sure Woody had some nice treats. We had a nice walk back home, where Woody decided it was best to try and snuggle up and sleep.
