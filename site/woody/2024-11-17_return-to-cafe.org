Woody just really wanted to go out for some coffee...

He got a fair bit of attention from people that came in. Positioned right by the door, it would have been rude if they didn't say hello to him!

It ended up being a really nice day! Woody enjoyed getting some more vitamin D and got to explore a trail along the river that he hadn't been along before. Thankfully, he didn't jump in.
