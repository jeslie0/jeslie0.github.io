The fog was back in full force this morning.

I have been under the weather for the previous week which meant limited walkies for Woody. I knew I had to make it up to him, so we went for a nice walk along the river this morning, through the fog. It was actually quite nice outside - the ground was dry and firm. Thankfully, no rain! Woody was very happy to get to go to Pets At Home on the walk and get a few bags of his favourite treats.
