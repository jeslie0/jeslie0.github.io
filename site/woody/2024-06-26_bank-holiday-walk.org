It was a bank holiday today, which I only discovered at the end of last week!

Woody and I met up with a friend from work and we went on a lunchtime walk in what felt like one of the last days of summer. We all went to a local pub and enjoyed a nice meal together. Woody was very well behaved and so was treated to a nice bone while we ate. He was very content and decided that he should nap afterwards. A good day, with good food and good company!
