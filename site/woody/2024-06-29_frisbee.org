It was a lovely evening so Woody and I went to play with our frisbee in the local park.

The sun was just right in the sky, and Woody let me take this lovely photo of him. He was very tired from sprinting about and fetching so well. I am so proud of Woody - it is very easy to think of times when he would never fetch anything outside, but now I trust him to come back to me even in the presence of other dogs. I know that Mohabat is proud of him.
