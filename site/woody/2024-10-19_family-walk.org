Woody had a lovely surprise on Saturday - Pop-pop and Nonna came to visit!

We went for a lovely walk to the lake at Virginia Water on probably the last day of summer of the year. Woody was very well behaved and got to make friends (and even some enemies) with many doggies. He particularly enjoyed the ice cream that he was given by the Italian man in the ice cream van. I'm sure he burnt it off with all the running about he did though.

He was also very well behaved in the car journey there and was particularly snuggly!
