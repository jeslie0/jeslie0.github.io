After a little trip to the vet (nothing to worry about!) Woody and I went on a long walk to the park close to where I used to live.

Woody was very good and could mostly be trusted to be free and off his leash! He did look like he wanted to join in the game of football that being played. I'm not sure how well that would have gone down, but, ain't no rules says a dog can't play football...
