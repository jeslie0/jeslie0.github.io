* About Me
I am a PhD student at the University of Western Ontario with Chris Kapulkin as my supervisor. I graduated with an integrated masters at the University of Edinburgh in July 2018 (supervised by Antony Maciocia) and started my PhD in September 2019. My areas of research include homotopy type theory and higher category theory. I am generally interested in foundations of mathematics and their relations to category theory.

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy running, cycling and swimming.
