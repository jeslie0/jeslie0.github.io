<p>
In mathematics, we are familiar with putting structure on sets, for example a group is a set with a binary operation satisfying certain properties. We can extend this notion to categories. The first examples I came across in my studies were monoidal categories, which are used to abstract the notion of a tensor product, and have deep ties to quantum mechanics and physics.

<div class="definition" id="orgd343065">
<p>
A <i>monoidal category</i> is a category \(\mathcal{C}\) with a functor \( \otimes: \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}\), an object \( I \in \mathcal{C}\) called the unit and the following natural isomorphisms, written in terms of their components:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An associator \(\alpha_{A,B,C}: (A \otimes B) \otimes C \rightarrow A \otimes (B \otimes C)\),</li>
<li>A left unitor \(\lambda_A: I \otimes A \rightarrow A\),</li>
<li>A right unitor \(\rho_A: A \otimes I \rightarrow A\).</li>
</ol>


<p>
These maps all have to satisfy the following diagrams, aptly named the triangle and pentagon identities.

((A \otimes B)\otimes C) \otimes D \arrow[ru, "{\alpha_{A,B,C} \otimes \text{id}_D}"] \arrow[rrd, "{\alpha_{A \otimes B, C , D}}"'] &                                                                                                     &                                                                                &                                                                                        & A \otimes (B \otimes (C \otimes D)) \\
                                                                                                                                    &                                                                                                     & (A \otimes B) \otimes (C \otimes D) \arrow[rru, "{\alpha_{A,B,C \otimes D}}"'] &                                                                                        &

These two diagrams remarkably lead to a coherence theorem which states that every well formed formula built from \(\alpha, \lambda, \rho\) and their inverses holds. This gives us for free that \( \rho_I = \lambda_I\), which would otherwise be very painful to prove.
</p>

<p>
The classic example of a monoidal category is \( \mathbf{Hilb}\), the category of Hilbert spaces with morphisms as bounded linear maps. The tensor functor simply gives the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces and the unit object is \( \mathbb{C}\), the complex numbers. The natural transformations are given in the obvious way. We can turn \( \mathbf{Set}\) into a monoidal category by having the \( \otimes\) functor give the Cartesian product of two sets and having the terminal object 1 as the unit.
</p>

<p>
The study of both \( \mathbf{Hilb}\) and \( \mathbf{Set}\) are useful for physics. The former is used to formalize quantum mechanics and the latter classical physics. One property that \(\mathbf{Hilb}\) has that \(\mathbf{Set}\) doesn't is the existence of a zero object. This is an object, denoted \(0\), which is both initial and terminal, that is, given any other object \( A\), there is exactly one morphism \( 0 \rightarrow A\) and exactly one morphism \( A \rightarrow 0\). It isn't hard to see that \( \mathbf{Hilb}\), the zero object is simply the Hilbert space consisting of just a zero vector. It is also not difficult to show that \( \mathbf{Set}\) doesn't have a zero object, since if it did it would need to be isomorphic to both the one element set and the empty set, which is impossible.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to see that in \( \mathbf{Hilb}\), we have \( 0 \otimes 0 \cong 0\). This is true for all monoidal categories with a zero object, as we shall now prove. I highly recommend trying this exercise for yourself first!
</p>

<p>
We have the following unique arrows: \( f: I \rightarrow 0\) and \( g:0 \rightarrow I\). These give rise to maps \( f \otimes 1_0:I \otimes 0 \rightarrow 0 \otimes 0\) and \( g \otimes 1_0: 0 \otimes 0 \rightarrow I \otimes0\). We then get the following composites:
</p>

<p>
&lt;a class="btn btn-rss" href="/feed.xml" target="<sub>blank</sub>"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\( 0 \xrightarrow{\lambda_0^{-1}} I \otimes 0 \xrightarrow{f \otimes 1_0} 0 \otimes 0\),</li>
<li>\(0 \otimes 0 \xrightarrow{g \otimes 1_0} I \otimes 0 \xrightarrow{\lambda_0} 0\).</li>
</ol>


<p>
As \( 0\) is a zero-object, there is only one map \( 0 \rightarrow 0\), namely the identity map \( 1_0\). This means
</p>

<p>
\(\left(\lambda_0 \circ (g \otimes 1_0)\right) \circ \left((f \otimes 1_0) \circ \lambda_0^{-1} \right)= 1_0\).
</p>

<p>
We also see that \( f \circ g:0 \rightarrow 0\), so \( f \circ g = 1_0\). We can then build the following commuting square:
</p>

<p>
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r, "g"] \arrow[d, "1_0"'] & I \arrow[d, "1_I"] \\
0                                  & I \arrow[l, "f"]  
\end{tikzcd} \]
</p>

<p>
We can apply the functor \( - \otimes 0\) to this square to get the following square:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \otimes 0 \arrow[r, "g \otimes 1_0"] \arrow[d, "1_0 \otimes 1_0"'] & I \otimes 0 \arrow[d, "1_I"]           \\
0 \otimes 0                                                          & I \otimes 0 \arrow[l, "f \otimes 1_0"]
\end{tikzcd}\]
</p>

<p>
Factoring \( 1_{I \otimes 0} = \lambda_0^{-1} \circ \lambda_0\) gives the following diagram:
</p>

<p>
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \otimes 0 \arrow[r, "g \otimes 1_0"] \arrow[d, "1_0 \otimes 1_0"'] & I \otimes 0 \arrow[d, "1_I"] \arrow[r, "\lambda_0"] & 0 \arrow[ld, "\lambda_0^{-1}"] \\
0 \otimes 0                                                          & I \otimes 0 \arrow[l, "f \otimes 1_0"]              &                               
\end{tikzcd}\]
</p>

<p>
We also know that \( 1_0 \otimes 1_0 = 1_{0 \otimes0}\), from the tensor product functor. As this commutes, we have \( \left((f \otimes 1_0) \circ \lambda_0^{-1} \right) \circ  \left(\lambda_0 \circ (g \otimes 1_0)\right) = 1_{0\otimes0}\). This results in the maps (1) and (2) being mutual inverses, hence \( 0 \cong 0 \otimes 0\), as required.
</p>

<p>
This is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to monoidal categories, for example, we might want \( A \otimes B \cong B \otimes A\), in which case we need to look at braided monoidal categories.
