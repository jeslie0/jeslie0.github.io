<p>
A month or two ago, my girlfriend, her brother and I went for a drive and came back with a puppy. My girlfriend had been wanting a puppy for many years; now that the day had come where she would get to take one home, she was beaming more than ever. When I lived in Scotland, my family raised and loved a yellow labrador (named Bobby), so I knew what to expect from the coming months. Or so I thought. Bobby came into my life when I was a mere 10 years old, so most of my memories of him are from the later stages in his life. My parents' memories of this time will probably be better than mine. I have the occasional memory of Bobby chewing on the skirting boards and urinating behind the sofa, but apart from that, he is a dream dog in my mind.
</p>

<p>
The new puppy (Woody) makes me doubt the integrity of my previous memories. Woody is a chocolate labrador, with an apt name. Anything in our vicinity made of wood will end up suffering the misfortune of being chewed on. The list of casualties includes chairs, desks, tables, skirting boards, book shelves, notebooks and, of course, twigs and branches. This is only the list of his wooden feasts. Woody also has a real taste for plastic and metal, which unfortunately we found out when he chewed his way through my girlfriend's bike's chain guard.
</p>

<p>
This brings me to my first reflection on Stoicism. Keeping a puppy that tries to destroy everything in reach reminded me of the temporary nature of belongings. It is far too easy to forget that even though we purchase items, they don't last forever. Even if they do out last us, we don't take them with us. We should appreciate what we have while we have it.
</p>

<p>
My second reflection is about anger. Before Woody came into my life, I thought that I was very hard to anger: I can't remember a recent time that felt really angry. Now though, it seems like every day my anger rises to the surface. This usually happens when Woody thinks it's a good idea to go around trying to eat everything in the house, including computer cables. When this happens, I have a real desire to punish Woody, but really this is only anger trying to take control. Punishment in the form of yelling or hitting serves no good, even in trying to get Woody's behaviour to change. Some say that it can even reinforce the behaviour. The only reason I have a desire to punish him is because of the anger that bubbles up. The only purpose it serves is as a release for me. I need to accept that chewing is a part of his nature, especially now that he is teething. The best thing to do is to try and redirect his attention to one of his many toys, designed for withstanding his mighty chomp. When he can't be redirected, it's time for him to sleep.
</p>

<p>
When my girlfriend and I were planning living with a new dog, I didn't think that Stoic values would be an important factor in raising it. I am glad that I was wrong.
</p>

<p>
Attached is a picture of the (not so little) Woody. Today, he has been a real star of a puppy and as I type this, he is fast asleep in his bed.

<p>
When one first starts studying category theory, they learn that the correct notion of "the same" for categories is that of equivalence, rather than the stronger notion isomorphism. For those that have studied some algebraic topology, the situation is very similar to identifying spaces if they are homotopic, rather than homeomorphic. This is often given as an analogy, but the two notions can be reconciled by giving model structures where the weaker form of identification forms the subcategory of weak equivalences. Here, we define and present the so called canonical model structure on the category of categories. The proof of each step given can also be applied to the category of groupoids. 
</p>

<p>
We denote the category of (small) categories by \(\mathbf{Cat}\) and the category of (small) groupoids \(\mathbf{Gpd}\).
</p>

<p>
This proof can be found on the nLab's "<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/canonical+model+structure+on+Cat">canonical model structure on Cat</a>" page, but here we go into a lot more detail of the constructions.

Let \(C\) be a category and \((A, B)\) a pair of subcategories. The pair \((A, B)\) is a <i>weak factorisation system</i> if:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Both \(A\) and \(B\) are stable under retracts;</li>
<li>\(A\) is in the left lifting class of \(B\) (\(A \subset LB\));</li>
<li>Every morphism \(f : X \to Y\) in \(C\) factors as \(f = pi\) with \(i \in A\) and \(p \in B\).</li>
</ol>

<div class="definition" id="org95c657a">
<p>
A <i>model structure</i> on a category \(\mathcal{C}\) consists of a triple of wide subcategories \(W, F, C \) whose morphisms are called <i>weak equivalences</i> (anotated with a \(\sim\)), <i>fibrations</i> (annotated with a double head \(\twoheadrightarrow\)) and <i>cofibrations</i> (annotated with a tail \(\rightarrowtail\)), respectively. This triple must satisfy the following three axioms:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(W\) satisfies 2-out-of-3;</li>
<li>\((F, W \cap C)\) is a weak factorisation system;</li>
<li>\((F \cap W, C)\) is a weak factorisation system.</li>
</ol>

<div class="definition" id="orgcdc51c8">
<p>
A <i>model category</i> is a finitely bicomplete category, along with a model structure on it.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Before giving the main result, we need one more definition.
</p>

<div class="definition" id="org8b48181">
<p>
Let \(F: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}\) be a functor. We say \(F\) is an <i>isofibration</i> if for every \(a \in \mathcal{A}\) and isomorphism \(f : Fa \to b \in \mathcal{B}\), there is an isomorphism \(g: a \to a' \in \mathcal{A}\) such that \(Ff = g\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
Our main result is the following:
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgeb95f40">
<p>
The category \(\mathbf{Cat}\) has a model structure on it with:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(W\) being the class of categorical equivalences;</li>
<li>\(F\) being the class of isofibrations;</li>
<li>\(C\) being the class of functors injective on objects.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
The rest of this section will be proving the above theorem. That \(\mathbf{Cat}\) and \(\mathbf{Gpd}\) has all finite limits follows from it having a terminal object, binary products and equalisers. The theory of categories and groupoids are generalised algebraic theories, so the category of models (\(\mathbf{Cat}\) and \(\mathbf{Gpd}\), respectively) has all (finite) colimits.
</p>

<p>
We now break down each of the defining features of a model structure and show that they hold here.

This follows by basic diagram chasing. If we have the following commuting triangle, with any two maps being equivalences, we can take pseudo-inverses to construct a pseudo-inverse to the third map.

The class of categorical equivalences is stable under retracts.

<div class="proof" id="org0affbd8">
<p>
Suppose we have the following commuting diagram where \(g\) is an equivalence. We show \(f\) is also an equivalence:
</p>
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X \arrow[r, "i"] \arrow[d, "f"] \arrow[rr, "1_X", bend left] & U \arrow[r, "u"] \arrow[d, "\sim", "g"'] & X \arrow[d, "f"] \\

  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

<p>
Since \(g\) is an equivalence, there exists a functor \(g'\) such that \(gg' \cong 1_V\) and \(g'g \cong 1_U\). The morphism \(pg'j\) is then easily seen to be a pseudo-inverse to \(f\), showing that it is also an equivalence.

<div class="lemma" id="org703ed12">
<p>
The class of isofibrations is stable under retracts.
</p>

</div>

<div class="proof" id="org2546d1e">
<p>
Suppose the following diagram commutes and \(g\) is an isofibration. We need to show that \(f\) is an isofibration also:
</p>
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X \arrow[r, "i"] \arrow[d, "f"] \arrow[rr, "1_X", bend left] & U \arrow[r, "p"] \arrow[d, "g", two heads] & X \arrow[d, "f"] \\

  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
<p>
Let \(x \in X\) and \(\alpha : fx \to y\) be an isomorphism in \(Y\). We apply \(j\) to get an isomorphism \(j\alpha : jfx=gix \to jy\). As \(g\) is an isofibration, there is an isomorphism \(\beta : ix \to u \in U\) such that \(g\beta = j\alpha\). Applying \(p\), we have an isomorphism \(p\beta : pix=x \to pu \in X\). If we apply \(f\) to this map, we have:
</p>
\begin{align*}
  fp\beta &= qg\beta && \text{right square}\\
          &= qj\alpha && \text{definition of }\beta\\
          &= \alpha.
\end{align*}
<p>
Hence, given an isomorphism \(\alpha\), there exists an isomorphism \(p\beta\) such that \(fp\beta = \alpha\), so \(f\) is also an isofibration.

Suppose we have the following diagram in \(\mathbf{Cat}\), where \(g\) is a functor injective on objects. We need to show that \(f\) is injective on objects also:

\begin{center}

    X \arrow[r, "i"] \arrow[d, "f"] \arrow[rr, "1_X", bend left] & U \arrow[r, "p"] \arrow[d, "g", tail] & X \arrow[d, "f"] \\

  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

<p>
Suppose \(x\) and \(y\) are objects in \(X\) such that \(fx = fy\). We have the following chain of equalities:
</p>
\begin{align*}
  fx = fy &\implies jfx=jfy\\
          &\implies gix=giy && \text{(left square)}\\
          &\implies ix=iy && (g \in C)\\
          &\implies pix=piy\\
          &\implies x=y.

Hence \(f\) is also injective on objects.

We first give a lemma that will be useful in solving the lifting problems in this section.
</p>

<div class="lemma" id="orge8f9267">
<p>
Isofibrations that are equivalences are exactly the equivalences that are surjective on objects.
</p>

</div>

<div class="proof" id="orge2133c3">
<p>
Suppose that \(F: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}\) is an isofibration and an equivalence. To see that it is surjective on objects, let \(b \in B\). As \(F\) is an equivalence, it is fully faithful, so there is some \(a \in \mathcal{A}\) and isomorphism \(\beta : Fa \to b \in \mathcal{B}\). As \(F\) is an isofibration, there is an isomorphism \(\alpha : a \to a' \in \mathcal{A}\) such that \(F\alpha = \beta\). Then, we must have that \(Fa' = b\), so \(F\) is surjective on objects.
</p>

<p>
If \(F\) is an equivalence that is surjective on objects, it is also an isofibration. Let \(a \in \mathcal{A}\) and \(\beta : Fa \to b\) be an isomorphism in \(\mathcal{B}\). As \(F\) is surjective on objects, \(b = Fa'\) for some \(a' \in \mathcal{A}\), so \(\beta\) is a map \(Fa \to Fa'\). By \(F\) being full, there is a morphism \(\alpha : a \to a'\) such that \(F\alpha = \beta\). By \(F\) being faithful, this \(\alpha\) must be an isomorphism, so \(F\) is an isofibration.
</p>

</div>

<div class="lemma" id="orgdccfe53">
<p>
The class of functors injective on objects has the left lifting property with respect to functors that are isofibrations and equivalences.
</p>

</div>

<div class="proof" id="orga6faccc">
<p>
Suppose we have the following commuting diagram, where \(f\) is injective on objects and \(g\) is an equivalence and isofibration:
</p>
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X \arrow[r, "i"] \arrow[d, "f"', tail] & U \arrow[d, "g"', "\sim", two heads] \\
    Y \arrow[r, "j"']                      & V                             
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

<p>
As this commutes, we have the following ``object square'' commuting in \(\mathbf{Set}\):
</p>
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X_0 \arrow[r, "i_0"] \arrow[d, "f_0"', tail] & U_0 \arrow[d, "g_0", two heads] \\
    Y_0 \arrow[r, "j_0"']                        & V_0                            
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

<p>
In particular, \(f_0\) is injective and by Lemma 10, \(g_0\) is surjective. As \((\text{inj}, \text{surj})\) form a weak factorisation system on \(\mathbf{Set}\), there is a lift \(h_0\). We now aim to turn \(h_0\) into a functor. Let \(\alpha: y \to y'\) be a morphism in \(Y\). We then have a morphism \(j\alpha : jy = gh_0y \to gh_0y'=jy' \in V_0\). As \(g\) is fully faithful, there is a unique morphism \(\beta : h_0 y \to h_0 y' \in U\) such that \(g\beta = j\alpha\). We define \(h\alpha := \beta\). As \(j\) is a functor, it must preserve identity morphisms and as \(g\) is fully faithful, the lift of an identity morphism from \(v\) to \(u\) must be the identity, so \(h\) preserves identity morphisms. Similarly, by functorality of \(j\) and fully faithfulness of \(g\), we have that composites are mapped to composites, so \(h\) is a functor and makes the bottom triangle commute:
</p>
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X \arrow[r, "i"] \arrow[d, "f"', tail] & U \arrow[d, "g"', "\sim", two heads] \\
    Y \arrow[r, "j"']  \ar[ru, "h"]                    & V                             
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

<p>
The top triangle commutes on objects, so we need to check it commutes on maps. Given \(\alpha : x \to x' \in X\),
</p>
\begin{align*}
  g i \alpha &= j f \alpha\\
             &= g h f \alpha
\end{align*}
<p>
So \(i \alpha = h f \alpha\) by fully faithfulness of \(g\), meaning that the top triangle commutes. This means that \(h\) is indeed a lift, which shows that functors injective on objects are in the left lifting class of fucntors that are equivalences and isofibrations.
</p>

</div>

<div class="lemma" id="org2a9302a">

Suppose we have the following diagram commuting, with \(f\) an equivalence that is injective on objects and \(g\) an isofibration:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X \arrow[r, "i"] \arrow[d, "f"', "\sim", tail] & U \arrow[d, "g", two heads] \\

\end{center}

<p>
To construct a functor \(h:Y \to U\), we use the axiom of choice to get some extra structure. As \(f\) is essentially surjective, for every object \(y \in Y\), we choose an isomorphism \(\alpha_y : fx_y \to y\), picking the identity morphism wherever possible, i.e \(\alpha_{fx} = 1_{fx}\) (we call the argument of \(f\) \(x_y\), which is well defined at \(f\) is injective on objects). As \(g\) is an isofibration, we choose for every \(y \in Y\) a morphism \(\beta_y : ix_y \to u_y \in U\) such that \(g\beta_y = j\alpha_y\), again, picking the identity morphism whenever possible, i.e \(\beta_{fx} = 1_{ix}\). On objects, we define \(h(y) = u_y\). For morphisms, the output is a little more complicated. Starting with a map \(\gamma : y \to y'\), we form the composite \(\alpha_{y'}^{-1} \gamma \alpha_y : fx_y \to fx_{y'}\). We let \(\overline{\alpha_{y'}^{-1} \gamma \alpha_y} : x_y \to x_{y'}\) be the unique map that \(f\) maps to \(\alpha_{y'}^{-1} \gamma \alpha_y\). Then, applying \(i\), we have a map \(i \overline{\alpha_{y'}^{-1} \gamma \alpha_y} : ix_y \to ix_{y'}\). We can then compose with maps \(\beta_y^{-1}\) and \(\beta_{y'}\) to get \(\beta_{y'} i \left(\overline{\alpha_{y'}^{-1} \gamma \alpha_y}\right) \beta_{y}^{-1} : u_y \to u_{y'}\). This is what we define \(h\gamma\) to be.
</p>

<p>
To see that \(h\) is a functor, we see that it sends the identity to the identity:
</p>
\begin{align*}
  \beta_{y} i \left(\overline{\alpha_{y}^{-1} 1_y \alpha_y}\right) \beta_{y}^{-1} &= \beta_y i\left( \overline{1_y}\right) \beta_y^{-1} \\
  &= \beta_y i(1_{x_y}) \beta_y^{-1}\\
  &=1_{u_y}.
\end{align*}
<p>
We also see that \(h\) preserves composites: let \(\gamma : y \to y'\) and \(\delta : y' \to y''\). Then:
</p>
\begin{align*}
  \beta_{y''} i \left(\overline{\alpha_{y''}^{-1} \delta \alpha_{y'}}\right) \beta_{y'}^{-1} \circ \beta_{y'} i \left(\overline{\alpha_{y'}^{-1}\gamma \alpha_y}\right) \beta_y^{-1} &=  \beta_{y''} i \left( \overline{\alpha_{y''}^{-1} \delta \alpha_{y'}}\right) i \left( \overline{\alpha_{y'}^{-1}\gamma \alpha_y}\right) \beta_y^{-1}\\
                                                                                                                                                                                     &= \beta_{y''}i \left( \overline{\alpha_{y''}^{-1} \delta \alpha_{y'}} \circ \overline{\alpha_{y'}^{-1} \gamma \alpha_y} \right) \beta_y^{-1}\\
  &= \beta_{y''} i \left( \alpha^{-1}_{y''} \delta \gamma \alpha_y \right) \beta_y^{-1}
\end{align*}

<p>
We now show that it makes both the triangles commute:
</p>
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X \arrow[r, "i"] \arrow[d, "\sim", "f"', tail] & U \arrow[d, "g", two heads] \\
    Y \arrow[r, "j"'] \arrow[ru, "h"]      & V                          
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

<p>
Given \(x \in X\), we need \(ix = u_{fx}\), however this follows from our choice of maps being the identity wherever possible, which means \(\beta_{fx} = 1_{ix}\). Likewise, for maps \(\gamma: x \to x'\), our chosen isomorphisms are the identity, giving \(hf\gamma = i\gamma\). Now, if \(y \in Y\), we see by definition that \(gu_y = jy\), so the bottom triangle commutes on objects. Given a map \(\gamma : y \to y' \in Y\), by the properties of \(\beta_y\) we have:
</p>
\begin{align*}
  g\left( \beta_{y'} i \left(\overline{\alpha_{y'}^{-1} \gamma \alpha_y}\right) \beta_{y}^{-1} \right) &= g(\beta_{y'}) gi \left(\overline{\alpha_{y'}^{-1} \gamma \alpha_y}\right) g(\beta_{y})^{-1}\\
                                                                                                         &= j(\alpha_{y'}) jf \left( \overline{\alpha_{y'}^{-1} \gamma \alpha_y} \right) j(\alpha_y)^{-1}\\
                                                                                                         &= j(\alpha_{y'}) j(\alpha_{y'})^{-1} j\gamma j(\alpha_y) j(\alpha_y)^{-1}\\
                                                                                                         &=j\gamma
\end{align*}

Hence \(h\) is a lift, as required.

Every functor can be factored as a functor injective on objects, followed by a functor that is an isofibration and equivalence.
</p>

</div>

<div class="proof" id="org900bb51">
<p>
Given \(f:X \to Y\), we form a new category \(Z\) with objects given by \(X_0 \coprod Y_0\). We define the hom-sets as follows:
</p>
\begin{align*}
  Z(x,y) := \begin{cases}
    x \in X, y \in X &\implies Y(fx, fy),\\
    x \in X, y \in Y &\implies Y(fx, y),\\
    x \in Y, y \in X &\implies Y(x, fy),\\
    x \in Y, y \in Y &\implies Y(x, y).
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

<p>
We then have a functor \(X \to Z\) which is the identity on objects, and \(f\) on maps, which, in particular, is injective on objects. We can also construct another functor \(Z \to Y\) which is formed by applying \(f\) to objects from \(X\) and the identity to objects from \(y\). It is then the identity morphism on maps, which means it is fully faithful. It is also surjective on objects as every object in \(Y\) is mapped to itself by this functor. The composite of these two morphisms is \(f\) on objects and \(f\) on maps, hence it is a factorisation of \(f\) into a functor injective on objects, followed by a surjective equivalence (which by Lemma 10) is an equivalence and isofibration), as required.

<p>
Given \(f:X \to Y\) we form the comma category \(F \downarrow 1_Y\), then take the full subcategory spanned by objects \((x, y, \phi : fx \to y)\) where \(\phi\) is an isomorphism in \(Y\). Denote this category as \(F \downarrow_{\cong} 1_Y\)
Note that we have a functor \(X \to F \downarrow_{\cong} 1_Y\) defined by sending \(x \mapsto (x , fx, 1_{fx})\) and \(\alpha : x \to x' \mapsto (\alpha, f\alpha)\). This is clearly injective on objects and fully faithful. We also have that every \((x, y, \phi) \cong (x, fx, 1_{fx})\) by the following commuting square in \(Y\) (with horizontal maps being isomorphisms):
</p>
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    fx \ar[r, "f1_{x}"] \ar[d, "\phi"'] & fx \ar[d, "1_{fx}"] \\
    y \ar[r, "\phi^{-1}"'] & fx
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

<p>
We have a functor \(f \downarrow_{\cong} 1_Y \to Y\) given by projecting out the second component. This functor is also seen to be an isofibration: given \((x, y, \phi)\) and an isomorphism \(\alpha : y \to y' \in Y\), the following square commutes, with horizontal maps isomorphisms, so is an isomorphism in \(f \downarrow_{\cong} 1_Y\):
</p>
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    fx \ar[r, "\phi"] \ar[d, "\phi"'] & y \ar[d, "\alpha"] \\
    y \ar[r, "\alpha"'] & y' 
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
<p>
Our projection functor sends this isomorphism to \(\alpha\), so it is an isofibration. The composite of the two functors defined is easily seen to be equal to \(f\), completing the factorisation of \(f\) as an equivalence that is injective on objects, followed by an isofibration.

This proves Theorem 5. To see that this restricts to \(\mathbf{Gpd}\) we only need to realise that if \(X\) and \(Y\) are groupoids, the categories constructed in the Factorisations section are also groupoids. This means we have the following:

<p>
I am currently a teaching assistant for a first year linear algebra course. We recently made the switch to a hybrid setup, meaning that I am streaming the tutorials on Zoom as well as talking to a class in-person. Instead of writing on the physical whiteboards in the classroom, I instead write on my iPad and share the screen through Zoom. Previously, when the tutorials were just based on Zoom, this setup worked pretty well - I can share my screen over Zoom using my home WiFi network. However, I can't screen share over the university network due to the way it is set up.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org9e4a386" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9e4a386">Solution 1</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9e4a386">
<p>
The basic solution is to log into the Zoom call on the iPad, and share the screen through the Zoom app. This is less than ideal, however; as it means that if you haven't turned off notifications, they can be displayed to the class. Also, I use the app GoodNotes to write my solutions on. The app is good, but there is a large header of different pen options that takes up too much space for my liking. This header is not shown when sharing content to Zoom over the network, rather than through the IPad.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc160198" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc160198">Solution 2</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc160198">
<p>
The current solution I use works on Windows 10 laptops. Windows 10 has the functionality to be connected to a network whilst also being a WiFi hotspot. Information on how to enable this can be found <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-your-pc-as-a-mobile-hotspot-c89b0fad-72d5-41e8-f7ea-406ad9036b85">here</a>. Once the hotspot is up and running, we can connect the iPad to the network. Then, Zoom can detect the IPad, and we can share content over this network. So far, this has worked well for me. The only caveat is that it seems like you can't get access to the internet on the IPad whilst connected to the network. This isn't a major problem for me, as I still have access through my laptop.
</p>

<p>
This setup might work for other operating systems, but I am not able to test that theory out.
